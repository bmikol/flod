# Flod

A simple shell script to track the time you spend on tasks, based upon a shell shared in the comments on Gina Trapani's Lifehacker article [Geek to Live: Quick-Log Your Work Day](https://lifehacker.com/geek-to-live-quick-log-your-work-day-189772).

## Future Plans

* Add ability to quickly submit your tasks as an argument
* Add shortcuts for tasks you repeatedly submit
* Create a companion script to parse and report total time spent on projects
